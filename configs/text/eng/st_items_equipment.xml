This is how the Israeli compression abdominal dressing manufactured by First Care Products came into being.\n Today, the bandage is the most technologically advanced, high-quality, convenient and popular army dressing device, exposed in flash points around the world, plus it has been put in service with the Israeli, USA and NATO countries nowadays.\n The device itself is a hybrid of bandage, wound dressing, medical tourniquet for pulling a limb and a tight pressure bandage. It is designed to stop heavy bleeding on wide surfaces - for example, chest, abdominal cavity or back. A tight fit to the body allows to use the device in the most "difficult" areas, for example, sloping and curved, like the neck, groin, buttocks, armpits, etc.\n Air is completely pumped out of both packaging layers, which allows to push the expiration date to unimaginable limits. Unlike other similar means, this bandage can be used with one hand.\n The only drawback of it is a quite high price.</text>
